\title{Detection Probability Curve Assuming Observed Normal Model}

\description{
Detection probability curve for label free shotgun proteomics data
assuming observed normal intensities.
}

\usage{
dpc(y, maxit = 100, eps = 1e-04, b1.upper = 1)
}

\arguments{
  \item{y}{
    numeric matrix of log2-transformed intensities.
    Rows correspond to peptide precursors and columns to samples.
    Any object such as an EList that can be coerced to a matrix is also acceptable.
  }
  \item{maxit}{maximum number of iterations.}
  \item{eps}{convergence tolerance.}
  \item{b1.upper}{upper bound for beta1.}
}

\details{
Estimate the detection probability curve (DPC) for label-free shotgun proteomics data using the method described by Li & Smyth (2023).
This function assumes that the observed log-intensities are normally distributed (the "observed normal" model),
and uses exponential tilting to reformulate the DPC in terms of observed statistics instead of in terms of unobserved quantities.
