\title{Detection Probability Curve Assuming Complete Normal Model}

\description{
Detection probability curve for label-free shotgun proteomics data
assuming a complete normal model for the peptide intensities.
}

\usage{
dpcCN(y, dpc.slope.start = 0.7, dpc.start = NULL, iterations = 2, subset = 1000, verbose = TRUE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{y}{numeric matrix of log2-intensities.
    Rows correspond to peptide precursors and columns to samples.}
  \item{dpc.slope.start}{starting value for the DPC slope.}
  \item{dpc.start}{numeric vector of length 2 giving starting values for the DPC intercept and slope.}
  \item{iterations}{number of outer iterations.}
  \item{subset}{maximum number of randomly selected rows of \code{y} to use in the calculation.}
  \item{verbose}{if \code{TRUE}, then progress information will be printed from each iteration.}
}

\details{
Estimate the detection probability curve (DPC) for label-free shotgun proteomics data
by maximum posterior assuming that the complete log-intensities are normally distributed (the "complete normal" model).
The complete log-intensities are the values that would have been observed if the missing value mechanism had not operated.

The algorithm uses an alternating iteration (Smyth, 1996), alternately estimating the row-wise means and standard deviations (mu and sigma) for fixed DPC and estimating the DPC for fixed mu and sigma.
The inner estimations use the BFGS algorithm implemented in the \code{optim} function.
Three outer iterations are usually sufficient.

\code{\link{dpc}} estimates the DPC by a different method, described in Li & Smyth (2023), based on exponential tilting and assuming that only the observed values are normally distributed (the "observed normal" model).
}

\note{
This function may underestimate the DPC slope if entirely missing peptides are omitted and the proportion of peptides that are entirely missing by chance is not small.

\code{dpcCN} can take several minutes on large datasets so, by default, progress information is turned on with \code{verbose=TRUE}.
The function will run quietly if \code{verbose=FALSE} is set.
